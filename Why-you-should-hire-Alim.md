He is truly gifted”

## What Alim Brings to the table

### Experience

[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) was always hired for his expertise and experience rather than his credentials. He is not a contest winner, however, he is adept at dealing with **real-world problems**. He prefers real-life problems more than programming contests.<br>
The Daily Star and the website of the ECE department at NSU all published Alim's research thesis.<br>

### Performance

[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) can perform at most **1.2x** to **1.5x** but forecasts what is wrong and right as a result (it also compiles out-of-the-box thinking) and outperforms this amount by **3x** to **4x**. (The limiting factor is the company's constraints - if they are bounded) and in reality, it takes time for everyone to learn in a new setting, but once **Alim** learns, he can onboard people at least 1.5 times faster than others. **Alim** cannot do two clicks at the same time, but he can clone the junior developer to work like him.<br>
Skill **replication** is crucial. Computers lack intelligence or competence, but we can teach it specific duties and train it so that it can be automated. **Alim** can **teach** new developers how to perform similarly to him by using the same techniques. A format is a very simple and efficient thing **Alim** introduces to new recruits.

For example, a junior developer can perform with 60%-80% efficiency, complementary if **Alim** knows the system and trains them they can persform as as **Alim** by his training and mentoring.<br>

### Expertise

Regular developer **mutates** code whereas **Alim** functional approach. He has a great **IDE coloring setup** to highlight any **mutating variable** and **reduce** the mutation. Mutation, in general, should be avoided unless you have a very good reason for it, mutation is bad.<br>
[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) prefers **functional programming** to code mutation. It has benefits over its tradeoffs. There are a few trade-offs with functional programming (a bit memory hungry). **However**, it has the added benefit of preventing coding errors, which saves many hours of **programming** time and **money** in the long run. It offers a greater **long-term** benefit. You do not need to consider the mutation and rely on the present value. **Alim** used functional programming to redesign the PersonalVPN (windows) to produce stable releases in the Windows version.
