### [← Back](alim-ul-karim-profile.md)

[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) is an expensive exquisite architect / engineer, however, you must not hire **Alim** if:<br>
- Your job doesn’t require experience person.
- You are on a tight budget or you run a small organization.

## Everyone wants the best

[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) received his degree from [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/) (No. 1 University in Bangladesh; internationally 600-800). As a result, he is more **pricey**. **Alim** is also an **experienced developer** with **17+** years of experience and 14+ years of industry experience with an excellent reputation. As a result, **Alim** is sought after by various companies all around the **globe**.

## Alim is **not** a One Trick Pony

Many senior developers **stop** learning new things as soon as they are experts in one particular framework. **Alim** is nothing like that.<br>
[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) explores many **framework** even in his early stage. He started with flash 2.0 at the time of his development very people used flash wish **VB6**. **Alim** explores more frameworks than other developers stop learning after learning a particular framework.<br>
Every day feels like a new life to **Alim** because he improves his skill many different skills so **solve** compound and complex problem. Which **develops** his skill everyday.<br>
If you are looking for a developer with low pay and only a minimal stack of old tech. **Alim** is not the right guy for you.<br>

## Quantity is Preferred

While it is true **Alim** can ask for a more **competitive** price during negotiation, he can also bring a lot to the table. **Alim** will help you reduce redundancy and save **memory consumption** in a steady process.<br>
You can argue that you may hire **multiple** programmers instead of Alim, but remember it's better to have one good boat than 3 sinking boats.<br>

## If you want blazing-fast code

[Md. Alim Ul Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimkarim/) does not make expected blunders, yet he takes longer than a junior developer. **Alim** does not work quickly, but he does work precisely.<br>
**Senior** developers are not faster ( a person with knowledge of the codebase is faster ) but they know **information** that can help troubleshoot problems. **Senior** developers are like **fire extinguishers**, you need them for safety issues and when there is a fire we cannot buy the fire extinguishers because it is already too late.<br>
In a long run, senior developers improve the **functionality** of the team and **productivity**, even though sometimes senior developers are delayed they improve the overall quality of the product.<br>
**Junior** developers are faster they don't know what will happen and take the short paths which make the job done faster but cause more issues in long run.<br>
If you are looking for fast and furious codes, don't hire Alim. **Alim** does not write quick code; nevertheless, he does write clean code, which is more important than writing fast code.<br>

**Writing** fast code may give you instant **gratification** but in the long run, you will not be able to **update** your code. Fast and messy code makes for quick delivery but soon you will no longer be able to add any new **features** without affecting your overall software **performance**.<br>
Alim dislikes **technical debt**, the more debt you accumulate, the more you must pay for it. If technical debt is not resolved **quickly**, it will continue to grow.
If you are looking for fast code, **Alim** is not your guy.<br>
