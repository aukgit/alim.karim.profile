__Current position:__ Senior Software Engineer at Validata

__Remarks__

I had the pleasure of working with Alim on multiple projects, and I highly recommend him as a software developer. He has a strong expertise in C#, unit testing and he always keeps code coverage in mind. Alim is a meticulous coder who ensures that his work meets the highest standards of quality. One particular achievement that stands out is his implementation of Azure storage, where he demonstrated a deep understanding of the technology and was able to design and build an efficient, scalable solution that exceeded our expectations.

Alim is also an excellent team player who communicates clearly and works collaboratively with others to achieve common goals. His positive attitude and willingness to lend his expertise to help solve problems make him a pleasure to work with. I am confident that he will be an asset to any team lucky enough to have him.

__Remarks__

I had the pleasure of working with Alim in Validata Group. Alim is a very smart Engineer and a hard-working person with excellent communication and mentoring skills. He understands complicated concepts and system architectures and he always makes sure that he shares the knowledge with his colleagues.
