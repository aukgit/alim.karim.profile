__Remarks:__ I joined Alim's team around 6 months ago, and we have been working together on C# Test Generator product, a tool that is able to automatically generate unit tests for C# projects. He was the sole developer of the team, before I joined it, and he had developed the tool from scratch. From the first moment I started working on the tool, I had realized how solid and of high quality the work he has done on the product was. The code was really well written, following common design patterns and conventions, and structured in such a way that allowed me to be productive in a very short amount of time.
As he has been my trainer, mentor and leader of the team, the preparatory work he has done on documenting the tool, but also his eagerness and readiness to help when needed, made my on-boarding process, maybe the smoothest on-boarding process I have had in my whole career. His great leading capabilities have been obvious from the first moment, as he is able to effectively handle work pressure and challenges set by higher management.
Before joining Alim's team, he has also been my mentor during "Bootcamp", a 4-week training program where candidates are educated on what is needed to succeed on the job. The tasks that he was preparing and assigning to me during that program were unveiling how committed professional he is and how skillful he is on software design and on capturing the "big picture".
His open-mindedness and nice personality makes him a very pleasant person to work with.
