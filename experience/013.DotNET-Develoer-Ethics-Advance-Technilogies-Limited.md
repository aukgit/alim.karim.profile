__Position in the organization:__ Programmer

__Current position:__ Assistant Director (Planning and Architecture) at Upay

__Remarks:__ I met Alim (as a kid / youngest .NET programmer) in 2007 during my work with EATL (at Bangladesh Shilpa Bank). It is a no-brainer that he has some exceptional problem-solving skills. He alone made software for a single Bank Department with 4+ Crystal Reports with dynamic capabilities to modify and change report structures from the application options. Though he didn't have the proper design principles knowledge like OOP and OOD at that stage, however, what he could do in that early was pretty impressive.

Moreover, he was very friendly and gentle enough to help others with complex problems. I wish him every success in his upcoming career. Good luck!
