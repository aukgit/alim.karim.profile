{x}-Product will contain __xbusiness-engines__ like WordPress template which will be __well-suited__ for each specific __business__ and additional changes can be done as additional layers over that template.

Moreover, {x}-Product will have it‚Äôs own __compiler__ which can __communicate__ with Node JS, C# and probably Java.
