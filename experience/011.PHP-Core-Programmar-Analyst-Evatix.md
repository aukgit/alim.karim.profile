__Remarks:__ I met Mr. Karim around 2010, he was just a kid and comparing his age, he was barely suited with us. However, his analyzing capabilities, database design abilities and quick adaption to any technology impressed all of us. Comparing the age he was barely suited, however with his qualities and abilities he was mostly one of us in no time. Finally, I would like to wrap up by wishing him a good luck in his future endeavors.
